## Usage

* Create a `CanvasLayer`.
* Add a `ColorRect` as a child node of the `CanvasLayer`.
* In the `ColorRect` properties:
  * Go to the **Material** section.
  * Click on the `[empty]` **Material** and load `crt_material.tres`.

If, for for reason, when loading `crt_material.tres` the `crt.shader` **Shader** is empty, just open it with any text editor, copy the code in the **Shader** editor and save it.
